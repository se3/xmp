<h2><a name="about_webpad_plugins"></a>About webpad plugins</h2>
<p>Blogging support in webpad is provided through a collection of plugins. You 
  can write your own plugins for webpad to access other sources of information. 
  Some ideas might be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access information stored in a company database for editing,</li>
  <li>Access email stored on your server in IMAP mailboxes,</li>
  <li>Extend the blogging support to other blogging platforms,</li>
  <li>Automatically check a file out from CVS and edit it, then check it back 
    in when you save it.</li>
</ul>
<p>All plugins work in a similar fashion - they provide access to a listing of 
  some sort, allow the user to select a specific 'file', then trigger an 'open' 
  sequence to load that 'file' into the edit window. If the user clicks 'Save', 
  it saves back to the plugin's data source. Plugins should also allow a user 
  to save back to them, using the normal 'Save/Save As' operations within webpad.</p>
<p>All plugins are stored in the <code>/plugins/</code> directory in webpad's 
  installation directory, and are accessed through the 'My Plugins' option in 
  the Locations Bar in 'Open File' and 'Save' windows.</p>

<h2><a name="installing_a_new_plugin"></a>Installing a new plugin</h2>
<p>Installing a plugin within webpad is just a simple process of copying the files 
  to the right location, and putting a single entry in the <code>configuration.php</code> 
  file.</p>
<p>All plugins should be installed in the <code>/plugins/</code> directory inside 
  webpad, within a directory of their own:</p>
<pre>
webpad_install/
     plugins/
          plugin1/
          plugin2/
</pre>
<p>The name you use for the directory within <code>/plugins/</code> is important. 
  It should be unique, and preferably short and easy to use in a number of locations 
  (See: <a href="#writing_your_own_plugin">Writing your own plugin</a> for more 
  reasons why). Inside your plugin directory, there will need to be at least 2 
  files:</p>
<pre>code.php
icon.gif
</pre>
<p>Each of these files is used by webpad for different things, and is required 
  for the plugin to work properly. webpad uses <code>icon.gif</code> as the icon 
  to display next to the plugin in the 'My Plugins' listing. <code>code.php</code> 
  should contain all core operational functions for the plugin (See: <a href="#writing_your_own_plugin">Writing 
  your own plugin</a> for more details).</p>
<p>Additional files for the plugin may be installed into this directory, or if 
  a collection of plugins are going to use common files, then another directory 
  at the plugins level may optionally be created. For example, the pre-installed 
  blogging plugins share a number of files, located in the <code>/plugins/_blogging/</code> 
  directory. <strong>Directories which are not an actual plugin (such as shared 
  code directories) should be prefixed with an underscore (_) to prevent them 
  from being listed as an available plugin.</strong></p>
<a href="#top" class="b2t">Back to top</a> 
<hr>
<h2><a name="configuring_a_plugin"></a>Configuring a plugin</h2>
<p>All plugins provide the information required to configure them directly to 
  the Settings page. This process is described in<a href="#required_functions_files"> 
  Writing your own plugin</a>. Once a plugin is installed, accessing the Settings 
  page should give you the option to 'Add' a new plugin configuration, and then 
  enter your settings for that particular plugin.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="writing_your_own_plugin"></a>Writing your own plugin</h2>
<p>webpad's plugin architecture allows you to easily add your own plugins for 
  accessing data from other sources. As mentioned in <a href="#about_webpad_plugins">About 
  webpad plugins</a>, there are a number of different ways you might choose to 
  use this functionality, or I'm sure you can come up with your own.</p>
<p>For the sake of the following section, assume we're dealing with a plugin called 
  &quot;myPlugin&quot; (so all files for the plugin should be in <code>/plugins/myPlugin/</code>)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In all plugin files, you should always use <code>dirname(__FILE__)</code> 
  for your <code>include</code> and <code>require</code> statements to avoid relative 
  directory name problems during operation.</p>
<h3><a name="required_functions_files"></a>Required functions/files</h3>
<p>Every plugin <strong>must</strong> have the following files in its directory:</p>
<pre>code.php
icon.gif
</pre>
<h4>code.php</h4>
<p>This file contains the main code of the plugin. Required functions in this 
  file are:</p>
<pre>myPlugin_validate_plugin($plugin)</pre>
<p>Accepts a single parameter <code>$plugin</code>, which is the array of configuration 
  options from <code>$config['plugins']</code> for this specific plugin. This 
  function should confirm that the <code>$plugin</code> array contains all the 
  information it needs to operate, and then return <code>true</code> if it does, 
  or <code>false</code> if it doesn't. If it returns <code>false</code>, the plugin 
  will not be listed as available.</p>
<pre>myPlugin_get_fields()</pre>
<p>Returns an array detailing what fields are required to configure this plugin. 
  This function is called by the Settings page to determine what fields are displayed 
  as part of the configuration for this plugin. The array passed back should look 
  something like this;</p>
<pre>
$fields = array();
$fields[] = array('name'=&gt;'nameOfField', 
                  'type'=&gt;['text' | 'password' | 'checkbox' | 'radio' | 'select'], 
                  'options'=&gt;[false | array('val1'=&gt;'LabelOne', 'val2=&gt;'LabelTwo')] );
</pre>
<p><code>options</code> are only required for <code>checkbox</code>, <code>radio</code> 
  and <code>select</code> field types, for <code>text</code> and <code>password</code>, 
  it should be set to <code>false</code>. The function should simply define the 
  array, and then <code>return</code> it; the Settings interface will handle everything 
  from there.</p>
<pre>myPlugin_get_title($plugin)</pre>
<p>This function accepts the same complete array of plugin configuration information, 
  and should return a string containing the title to be displayed in the listing 
  of available plugins. Keep in mind that multiple copies of the same plugin may 
  be configured, so you should return a unique title, based on the specific configuration 
  in the <code>$plugin</code> array.</p>
<pre>myPlugin_listing($plugin, $id)</pre>
<p>This function is responsible for generating a complete listing of available 
  'files' within this plugin, and is called from <code>browse_plugin.php</code> 
  for a specific plugin/configuration. Based on the details in <code>$plugin</code>, 
  which is plugin number <code>$id</code> to be configured, it should generate 
  a listing, and <code>return</code> the HTML to display details for this plugin. 
  See <a href="#common_items_operations_to_implement">Common items/operations 
  to implement</a> for more details on what you should be aiming to implement 
  here.</p>
<pre>myPlugin_open()</pre>
<p>This function takes no parameters, so it should rely solely on <code>$_SESSION</code> 
  variables to determine which file was requested and other details. It should 
  return a string containing the entire file to be loaded into webpad. If you'd 
  like to pass a message back to the user upon success/failure, declare <code>global 
  $javascript_msg;</code> and set it to a string containing your message. If it 
  starts with a &quot;@&quot;, then it is an error message. It will be <code>alert</code>'ed 
  (without the @) and used as the <code>window.status</code>.</p>
<pre>myPlugin_save($name, $str)</pre>
<p>This function takes 2 parameters, which should be enough, when combined with 
  the available <code>$_SESSION</code> variables, to save the contents of the 
  edit window to the specified destination with this plugin. Once the item is 
  saved, this function should return the new filename for this file (or the old 
  one if it hasn't changed). If you'd like to pass a message back to the user 
  upon success/failure, declare <code>global $javascript_msg;</code> and set it 
  to a string containing your message. If it starts with a &quot;@&quot;, then 
  it is an error message. It will be <code>alert</code>'ed (without the @) and 
  used as the <code>window.status</code>.</p>
<h4>icon.gif</h4>
<p>This is the icon used in the 'My Plugins' listing of available plugins. The 
  image should be 18 x 18 px, on a white background. If you like, a 2px drop shadow 
  done at 120<sup>o</sup> in black, at 75% opacity may also be added.</p>
<h3><a name="functions_and_variables" id="functions_and_variables"></a>Functions 
  and variables</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All functions should be prefixed with the plugin's name (e.g. <code>myPlugin_my_function_to_do_something()</code>)</li>
  <li>If you need to use additional <code>$_SESSION</code> variables, they should 
    be named like this to avoid naming conflicts: <code>$_SESSION['plugin_myPlugin_*']</code></li>
  <li>There are some global variables that you might need to access, especially 
    in opening and saving data to/from your plugin: 
    <ul>
      <li><code>$_SESSION['filename']</code> contains the actual filename of the 
        current file, including any relevant path information.</li>
      <li><code>$_SESSION['display_filename']</code> contains the name used to 
        display in the window title. This is normally just the actual file name 
        (no path information)</li>
      <li><code>$_SESSION['plugin_identifier']</code> is the best place to store 
        your information if you don't need additional variables. This variable 
        is made available purely for the active plugin to manipulate. You can 
        use an internal string separator to store multiple things in there at 
        once.</li>
      <li><code>$_SESSION['plugin']</code> should always contain the index number 
        of the active plugin (the index for its configuration within <code>$config['plugins']</code>)</li>
      <li><code>$config</code> (you will need to declare this as <code>global</code> 
        within your functions) contains all configuration data for webpad</li>
      <li><code>$config['plugins'][$_SESSION['plugin']]</code> should contain 
        all configuration data for the active plugin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="common_items_operations_to_implement"></a>Common items/operations 
  to implement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Server and FTP Server files are listed with the icon <code>/images/files_file.gif</code> 
    which is 19 x 18 px on a white background, and has <code>align=&quot;absmiddle&quot;</code> 
    applied to it.</li>
  <li>You should be able to open a 'file' using a double-click of the mouse. This 
    is triggered using the <code>ondblclick</code> event handler to select the 
    file and trigger a form submission at the same time.</li>
  <li>You can include the colored selection code in your listings using the JavaScript 
    samples in <code>/js/files.js</code></li>
  <li>To access the plugins toolbar (See: <a href="#accessing_the_plugins_toolbar">Accessing 
    the plugins toolbar</a> for more info), you should include <code>/js/plugins.js</code> 
    in any additional plugin pages you create.</li>
  <li>To make any additional plugin browsing pages look like other file-listing 
    pages, you can include <code>/css/files.css</code></li>
  <li>It's a good idea to update the 'active plugin' value yourself using something 
    like this (where x is the <em>numbered index</em> of this plugin):<br>
    <code>parent.document.file.plugin.value = x; </code></li>
  <li>You can (and should) update the 'current directory' box above the browse 
    window using JavaScript like this:<br>
    <code>parent.document.file.current_dir.value = 'Current Directory Title Here'; 
    </code></li>
  <li>If you don't want the user to be able to edit the filename in a save or 
    open operation, you can make the filename field read only using this:<br>
    <code>parent.document.file.filename.readOnly = true;</code></li>
  <li> To reference the content of the active file, you need to access this:<br>
    <code>top.opener.parent.frames.wp_edit.document.edit.wp_document.value</code></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="accessing_the_plugins_toolbar" id="accessing_the_plugins_toolbar"></a>Accessing 
  the plugins toolbar</h3>
<p>You can modify the contents of the toolbar on the plugins browse window. There 
  is room for up to 3 additional tools (you can't modify the far-left icon, which 
  is for changing the active plugin). The following JavaScript functions are available 
  if you include <code>/js/plugins.js</code> in your plugins pages (it is already 
  included when <code>myPlugin_listing()</code> is called).</p>
<pre>add_plugin_tool(icon, href, tooltip, position)</pre>
<p>Using this function, you can add a tool to the toolbar for interacting with 
  your plugin. <code>icon</code> is a filename for the icon to use in the toolbar. 
  The image should be a transparent background gif, over a matte to the hex code 
  <code>#3A85E1</code>. It should be 25 x 25px. <code>href</code> is the exact 
  <code>HREF</code> to apply as a link to the icon (probably something like <code>javascript:do_something();</code>). 
  <code>tooltip</code> will become the <code>TITLE</code> attribute of the link, 
  and will appear if the user hovers over it for a second. <code>position</code> 
  is a number from 1 to 3, representing the position to place this tool at. 1 
  is closest to the 'Change Active Plugin' tool (far left) and 3 is far right.</p>
<pre>remove_plugin_tool(position)</pre>
<p>This will remove (clear) the tool at <code>position</code>. position should 
  be a number from 1 to 3 representing which tool to remove.</p>
<pre>clear_plugin_tools()</pre>
<p>This function will simply clear all plugin tools (positions 1 - 3).</p>
