<h2><a name="using_webpad"></a>Using webpad</h2>
<h3><a name="launching_webpad_normally"></a>Launching webpad normally</h3>
<p>To access webpad normally, all you need to do is 'hit' the URL of the directory 
  where it is installed. For example, if you copied the webpad files into the 
  <code>/webpad/</code> directory on your server, then you would need to access 
  <code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/</code>.</p>
<p>You will be presented with a screen asking you to log in. Enter the username 
  and password you specified during installation/configuration and hit the 'Log 
  In' button. webpad will load up with a new file and you can start using it. 
</p>
<h3><a name="launching_webpad_in_a_new_window"></a>Launching webpad in a new window</h3>
<p>If you'd like to load webpad into a new window sized just right for it, then 
  you can easily do so. Just point your browser to the directory that you installed 
  webpad in, and then add <code>launch.php</code> to that. For example, if you 
  installed webpad at <code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/</code> then you 
  would want to access <code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/launch.php</code></p>
<p>webpad will load into a new window, and the current browser will be sent back 
  to the last page that you were at. If you need to log in to webpad, then you 
  will be asked to do so, otherwise it will load completely.</p>
<h3><a name="launching_webpad_from_a_bookmarklet"></a>Launching webpad from a 
  bookmarklet</h3>
<p>A really handy way to load webpad is using a shortcut from your browser's 'Links' 
  or 'Bookmarks' toolbar. This is called a 'bookmarklet', and you can load webpad 
  just like this really easily.</p>
<p>All you need to do is copy the link below into your toolbar (you can normally 
  just drag the link to the toolbar and it will copy). From then on, you can easily 
  click the bookmarklet and webpad will launch. You will even get an option to 
  load the source code of the page you're currently viewing (when you click the 
  link), or you can just load webpad in a console.</p>
<p> 
  <script language="JavaScript">
<!--
document.writeln("<a href=\"javascript:if(currentURL=escape(location.href)){Xsize=370;Ysize=150;locateX=(screen.width-Xsize)/2;locateY=(screen.height*0.9-Ysize)/2;void(webpad_launched=window.open('" + document.location.href.substring(0, document.location.href.lastIndexOf("/")) + "/../launch.php?u='+currentURL,'webpad','width='+Xsize+',height='+Ysize+',left='+locateX+',top='+locateY+',screenX='+locateX+',screenY='+locateY+',toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,copyhistory=no'));}\"><strong>webpad</strong></a>");
// -->
</script>
</p>
<h3><a name="loading_a_file_from_a_link"></a>Loading a file from a link</h3>
<p>webpad also supports opening a file directly from a link. This is useful for 
  web-based file management integration, where you'd like to provide a direct 
  link to edit the contents of a file on the server that webpad is installed on.</p>
<p>To create a link directly to webpad, you need to put together the following 
  pieces;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The URL to webpad</li>
  <li>A 'type' (<code>?t=</code>) of either 'server' (to open a file on your server) 
    or 'http' (to open the source of a webpage)</li>
  <li>The full path (or URL) to the file you want to open (<code>&amp;f=</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, to open the file <code>/usr/home/webpad/file.html</code> from 
  the server, assuming you installed webpad at <code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/</code>; 
  you would create a link pointing to the following;</p>
<p><code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/?t=server&amp;f=/usr/home/webpad/file.html</code></p>
<p>There are a few things you should be aware of:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You need to be logged into webpad already; otherwise it will force you to 
    log in and will discard the request for a file.</li>
  <li>If you request a file from the server, it must fall somewhere inside your 
    webpad home directory or a security violation will be triggered and webpad 
    will close</li>
  <li>You should encode special characters in the filename to avoid problems. 
    You can do this using something like <code>str.escape()</code> (in JavaScript) 
    or <code>urlencode($str)</code> (in PHP).</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="working_with_files"></a>Working With Files</h2>
<h3><a name="creating_a_new_file"></a>Creating a new file</h3>
<p>Click the 'New File' icon in webpad's toolbar to create a new file. If you 
  have any templates installed (See: <a href="#webpad_templates">webpad templates</a> 
  for more info), then you'll get an option to open a template to work from (using 
  the keyboard shortcut bypasses the template option).</p>
<p>You can pick a template from the list of available ones, or pick 'Blank File' 
  to load an empty file and start from scratch. Click 'New' when you've made your 
  choice and webpad will open the requested file.</p>
<h3><a name="on_your_computer"></a>On your computer</h3>
<h4><a name="opening_files_on_your_computer"></a>Opening files on your computer</h4>
<p>To open any text-based file from your computer, just click the 'Open File' 
  icon in webpad's toolbar, and then if it's not already selected, click the 'My 
  Computer' icon in the Locations Bar on the left of the Open File window. On 
  the left, you will see a box marked 'File:' with a 'Browse' button next to it. 
  Click the button.</p>
<p>This should open a window where you can browse the files on your computer and 
  select the one you would like to edit in webpad. Once you have located the file 
  to open, select it and click 'Open'. Now click 'Open' in webpad's window as 
  well.</p>
<p>The file will be uploaded to webpad's server and stored temporarily while you 
  edit it (don't worry; it gets deleted when you're done).</p>
<h4><a name="saving_files_to_your_computer"></a>Saving files to your computer</h4>
<p>You can also save any file you are editing in webpad directly to your computer 
  (including opens you opened from your server, a remote FTP server or anywhere 
  else). To do this, just click 'Save As' in the toolbar, and then select 'My 
  Computer' in the Locations Bar on the left of the File Save window.</p>
<p>Now you can enter a name for the file, and pick what type it is. Once you're 
  done, click 'Save'. webpad will tell your browser to download the file, so you 
  will get a window asking you if you'd like to open or save the file. Select 
  'Save to disk' (or similar) and click 'Ok'. Now you will need to browse to where 
  you'd like to save the file on your computer, and then click 'Ok' again. The 
  file will save and you can go back to editing in webpad.</p>
<h3><a name="on_the_server_webpad_is_on"></a>On the server webpad is on</h3>
<h4><a name="opening_files_from_the_server_webpad_is_on"></a>Opening files from 
  the server webpad is on</h4>
<p>webpad is perfect for making changes to your website without having to download 
  and upload files all over the place. It accesses the files directly on your 
  server, so you can see your changes immediately once you save the file. To open 
  a file on the webpad server, just click the 'Open File' icon in the toolbar, 
  and then select 'My Server' in the Locations Bar.</p>
<p>Now you will see a window where you can browse the contents of your server, 
  starting at your home directory (you can't go outside of that directory and 
  its sub-directories for security reasons). Browse to different directories by 
  clicking once on a directory name. If you don't have permission to access a 
  file or directory, then you won't be able to click on it.</p>
<p>Once you find the file you would like to edit, you can either double-click 
  it, or click it once, then click the 'Open' button to open it in webpad.</p>
<h4><a name="saving_files_to_the_server_webpad_is_on"></a>Saving files to the 
  server webpad is on</h4>
<p>Any file that you have open can be saved directly to your server. All you need 
  to do is click 'Save As' in the toolbar then click 'My Server' in the Locations 
  Bar'. Now you can navigate the directory where you'd like to save the file.</p>
<p>Once you're in the right directory, you can either enter a name for the file, 
  or select an existing file to overwrite. If you are going to overwrite a file, 
  you'll need to confirm that that's really what you want to do. After entering 
  a name (or selecting a file), just click the 'Save' button and the file will 
  be saved and you'll be returned to webpad.</p>
<h4><a name="extra_server_file_management_tools"></a>Extra server file-management 
  tools</h4>
<p>webpad has a few extra tools to help you manage the files on your server. These 
  tools are available from the File window, either when you Open or Save a file 
  to the webpad server.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Home</strong><br>
    Takes you back to your home directory.</li>
  <li><strong>New Directory</strong><br>
    Click this once, then enter the name of a new directory to create it within 
    the current directory.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete Selected File</strong><br>
    Select a file, and then click this icon to delete that file permanently. You 
    will be asked to confirm just to make sure.</li>
  <li><strong>Rename Selected File</strong><br>
    To rename a file, just select it, and then click this icon. You will be prompted 
    for a new name for the file.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="via_ftp"></a>Via FTP</h3>
<h4><a name="opening_files_from_an_ftp_server"></a>Opening files from an FTP server</h4>
<p>If you have configured access to a remote FTP server (or multiple servers) 
  you will be able to open and save files to and from the server just like anywhere 
  else. Click 'Open File' in the toolbar and then select 'FTP Server' in the Locations 
  Bar. If you have more than one server configured, you'll need to pick which 
  one you'd like to open a file from, otherwise the only one configured will be 
  assumed.</p>
<p>Once you are logged into your FTP server, you can browse around just like accessing 
  files on the webpad server (albeit a little slower normally). Once you find 
  the file you're looking for, double-click it, or click it, then click 'Open' 
  to open it in webpad.</p>
<h4><a name="saving_files_to_an_ftp_server"></a>Saving files to an FTP server</h4>
<p>Saving a file to FTP works just like saving to the webpad server. Click 'Save 
  As', select 'FTP Server' in the Locations Bar, then navigate to where you'd 
  like to save the file. Enter a name and click 'Save' and you're done! As with 
  the webpad server, you'll need to confirm it if you want to save over a file 
  that's already there.</p>
<h4><a name="extra_ftp_server_tools"></a>Extra FTP server tools</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Change Active Server</strong><br>
    Clicking this will take you back to the list of available FTP servers so you 
    can choose which one to work with. This option will disappear if you only 
    have one server configured.</li>
  <li><strong>FTP Home Directory</strong><br>
    This will take you back to the home directory of the active FTP account.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="using_plugins"></a>Using plugins</h3>
<h4><a name="opening_a_file_from_a_plugin"></a>Opening a file from a plugin</h4>
<p>Plugins give webpad the ability to access other locations to load files from. 
  webpad Personal and Enterprise come pre-loaded with plugins to handle the following 
  blogging platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.blosxom.com/" target="_blank">blosxom</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">Blogger.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/livejournal/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/" target="_blank">MovableType</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/" target="_blank">TypePad</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to configure your details for each of these platforms during 
  installation/configuration, so please have a look at the <a href="installation.html">Installation 
  Instructions</a> for more details on this.</p>
<p>Once you have your blogs configured, you can access the directly through webpad, 
  as if they were any other file. Just click 'Open File' and then click 'Plugins' 
  in the Location Bar. Now you will see a list of available plugins to select 
  from. Click on one of the plugins and you will go to a listing for that plugin. 
  For some blogging platforms, you will get a list of available blogs, for others 
  you will go straight to the entries. If you only have one blog available, you 
  will also go straight to the entries.</p>
<p>Once you locate the file/entry you'd like to edit, select it by either double-clicking, 
  or click it once, then click the 'Open' button. It should now open directly 
  in webpad where you can edit it.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Blog entries open in webpad with the title on the first 
  line. Whatever is entered on the first line will be used as the title of the 
  entry when it is published on your blog!</p>
<h4><a name="saving_a_file_to_a_plugin"></a>Saving a file to a plugin</h4>
<p>As with other file-types, just click 'Save As' and then select 'Plugins' in 
  the Locations Bar. Navigate to the plugin you'd like to save this file using, 
  and then enter a name and click 'Save'</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When saving a blog entry (except for blosxom), the first 
  line of the file is used as a title automatically, and you don't need to specify 
  a file name. With blosxom, you will need to enter a file name just like saving 
  to your server.</p>
<h4><a name="extra_plugin_tools"></a>Extra plugin tools</h4>
<p>Some plugins will load additional tools into the plugin toolbar while you are 
  accessing them. All of the blogging plugins will give you the option to delete 
  entries. Just select an entry and then click the 'Delete Selected Entry' button 
  to delete it permanently.</p>
<h3><a name="loading_the_source_of_a_webpage"></a>Loading the source of a webpage</h3>
<p>webpad can load the source code of a webpage so you can check it out, or save 
  a copy for yourself. All you need to do is click 'Open File' in the toolbar, 
  and then select 'Webpage' from the Locations Bar. Enter the URL of the page 
  you'd like to open, and then click 'Open' to load it directly into webpad.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can't save a file directly to a URL - that wouldn't 
  make any sense!</p>

<h2><a name="webpad_tools"></a>webpad Tools</h2>
<h3><a name="uploading_files_to_the_server"></a>Uploading files to the server</h3>
<p>If you have configured webpad to allow file uploads, then you can upload any 
  file to your server using the 'Upload File' button in the toolbar. Just click 
  it to open the 'Upload File' window. With the window open, click the 'Browse' 
  button to locate the file you'd like to upload from your computer. Once you've 
  found it, click 'Open', then click 'Upload' in webpad's upload window.</p>
<p>The file will upload to a temporary location on your server, and then webpad 
  will prompt you for a location to save it too permanently. Browse to a location 
  on your server; enter a filename and click 'Save'.</p>
<h3><a name="emailling_a_file"></a>Emailing a file</h3>
<p>You can send a copy of any open file via email if you have configured webpad 
  to allow emailing. With a file open, just click the 'Send File As Email' button 
  in the toolbar. This will open the 'Send File As Email' window, where you should 
  enter an email address to send the file to (you can enter more than one, just 
  separate them with a comma - ','). Enter a subject for the email, and then click 
  'Send'. The email will appear to come from the name and email address displayed 
  in the window (which was configured as part of <a href="installation.html">installation/configuration</a>). 
  If your document contains &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot; then it will automatically 
  be sent as an HTML-formatted email message, otherwise it will be sent as plain 
  text.</p>
<h3><a name="printing_a_file"></a>Printing a file</h3>
<p>If you'd like to print a file you are editing in webpad, you should use webpad's 
  'Print File' button. When you click the button, a new window will open, with 
  your file formatted for printing. The print operation will be triggered automatically, 
  so you'll just need to confirm that you'd like to print and it will begin.</p>
<h3><a name="go_to_line"></a>Go to line</h3>
<p>Often, you will need to jump directly to a specific line in a file (especially 
  if you're debugging some code). To do this, just click the 'Go To Line' button 
  in the toolbar. You will be asked which line you'd like to go to. Enter a number, 
  and then click 'Ok' and you will jump straight to the start of that line.</p>
<h3><a name="find_and_find_next"></a>Find &amp; Find Next</h3>
<p>Using the 'Find' button, you can locate any text in your file. Click the button, 
  and then enter the text you're looking for and click 'Ok'. You will jump to 
  the next occurrence of that string, and it will be highlighted to show you where 
  it is. If you'd like to keep finding more occurrences, just keep clicking the 
  'Find Next' button next to it in the toolbar.</p>
<h3><a name="find_and_replace"></a>Find &amp; Replace</h3>
<p>You can replace all occurrences of a string with another one using the 'Find 
  &amp; Replace' window. Click the 'Find &amp; Replace' button in the toolbar, 
  and then enter the text you're looking for in the 'Find:' box. Enter what you'd 
  like to replace it with in the 'Replace:' box. If you only want to match the 
  same upper/lower case text, then check the 'Match Case?' box. Now click 'Replace 
  All' to replace all occurrences of the string with the replacement.</p>
<h3><a name="html_tools"></a>HTML tools</h3>
<p>webpad comes with a collection of useful HTML tools for editing and creating 
  HTML files. Here's a brief outline of what's available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bold</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-b)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it in &lt;strong&gt; tags, or click 
    it without a selection to insert the tags into your file.</li>
  <li><strong>Italics</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-i)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it in &lt;em&gt; tags, or click it 
    without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>

    or click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Blockquote</strong><br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it in &lt;blockquote&gt; tags, or 
    click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Left Align</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-l)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it a &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt; 
    tag, or click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Center Align</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-e)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it a &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
    tag, or click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Right Align</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-r)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it a &lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; 
    tag, or click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Justify</strong> (ctrl/opt-shift-j)<br>
    Select some text and click this to wrap it a &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt; 
    tag, or click it without a selection to insert the tags into your file. </li>
  <li><strong>Insert Color (Hex code)</strong><br>
    Click this and then pick a color from the palette. The hex code for that color 
    will be inserted into your file.</li>
  <li><strong>Insert Table</strong><br>
    Enter the number of rows and columns, plus some other details, to insert the 
    skeleton of an empty table into your file.</li>
  <li><strong>Insert List</strong><br>
    Pick which type of list you'd like (bullets, numbers, different styles), then 
    enter each of the items. When you're done, click 'Insert' to insert the HTML 
    required to create the list into your file.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="previewing_a_file_as_html"></a>Previewing a file as HTML</h3>
<p>If you're editing an HTML file, you can use the 'Preview As HTML' button to 
  load the contents of your file into a new window, and render it as a webpage. 
  This is a good way to get a quick preview and see how it looks. Keep in mind 
  that unless you are using absolute addresses to things like CSS and JavaScript 
  files and images, then most of them will appear broken.</p>

<p>You can install any number of templates in webpad so that you can easily create 
  a new instance of that file from the 'New File' window. To create a webpad template, 
  just create a normal text-based file, and then save it to the <code>/templates/</code> 
  directory inside webpad's install directory with the <code>.wpt</code> extension.</p>
<p>When they are loaded, the filenames of all <code>*.wpt</code> files in the 
  /templates/ directory are 'prettied up'. Underscores (_) are converted to spaces 
  and the <code>.wpt</code> is stripped from the end. For example, <code>This_is_a_webpad_template.wpt</code> 
  will become &quot;This is a webpad template&quot; in the template selection 
  box.</p>
<p>webpad comes packaged with a number of sample templates for HTML and XHTML-compliant 
  documents. </p>

<h4><a name="about_webpad"></a>About webpad</h4>
<p>webpad was written to provide a simple interface for accessing files on a server. 
  From that origin, it grew to become a single spot to accessing all sorts of 
  files which are online, in a number of formats and locations. webpad is written 
  using a combination of <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a>, 
  <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/3.0/handbook/javascript/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> 
  and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank">Cascading Style sheets</a>, 
  with the interface being completely <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/" target="_blank">HTML</a> 
  (no plugins required!)</p>
<p>A few interesting facts about webpad:</p>
<ul>
  <li>webpad development started in about 2000.</li>
  <li>webpad has been downloaded well over 4,000 times from the <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/webpad/" target="_blank">Dented 
    Reality</a> website. </li>
  <li>webpad is made up of around 150 files!</li>
  <li>Apart from some beta testing and a few suggestions here and there, webpad 
    is entirely developed by <a href="#about_the_developer">Beau Lebens</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always get the latest version, and read this documentation online at

<h4><a name="about_the_developer"></a>About the developer</h4>
<p>webpad is developed by me, <a href="mailto:beau@dentedreality.com.au">Beau 
  Lebens</a>. I'm a web developer who's been creating things online since about 
  1996. Originally based in Perth, Western Australia, I'm now in the US working 
  hard as always. I made webpad originally because I wanted a simple way to edit 
  files quickly on my website, without having to download, edit and then upload 
  them. In those days it only worked in Internet Explorer, and even there, only 
  sometimes.</p>
<p>Since version 1, I've added <strong>stacks</strong> of extra tools and features 
  to make webpad more useful and powerful, plus I've improved the security and 
  stability of it, and made it work in browsers other than IE to boot. I maintain 
  webpad because I find it useful: it's been the main tool in managing all the 
  websites I have for over 3 years now. If you like it as well, or find it useful, 
  I'd love to <a href="webpad@dentedreality.com.au">hear about it</a>, so drop 
  me a line and tell me how you're using it.</p>
