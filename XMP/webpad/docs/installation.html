<h2><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
<h3><a name="server_requirements"></a>Server requirements</h3>
<p>webpad is pretty light on your server, and doesn't require too many additional 
  modules, but there are some that you will need. These tend to be very common, 
  so if you don't know, then give it a try and you probably have them already!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apache (tested on 1.34 only) or IIS</li>
  <li>PHP4 (most recent versions will be fine), running either in CGI mode, or 
    as a server module.</li>
  <li>cURL (for blogging, and opening the source of webpages).</li>
  <li>expat (xml functions, again for blogging. These should be enabled by default, 
    so unless they've been disabled, you should be fine).</li>
  <li>FTP functions (some web hosts disable these functions for security reasons, 
    but generally you should be fine).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="client_browser_requirements"></a>Client (browser) requirements</h3>
<p>webpad currently supports the following browsers/platforms. It <em>may</em> 
  support others, but due to the complexity of some of the JavaScript used (specifically 
  for the HTML tools), it may not perform entirely as expected. All browsers will 
  need <strong>JavaScript, cookies and CSS enabled</strong>, and you should <strong>allow 
  popups</strong> for the domain you have webpad installed on in any popup blocking 
  tools you have.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Windows 2000/XP</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Internet Explorer 6.0+</li>
      <li>Mozilla Firefox 1.0+</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Macintosh OS X</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Mozilla Firefox 1.0+</li>
      <li>Mozilla Camino 0.8+</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Screen Resolution: 1024 x 768+</strong> (there are lots of tools 
    in the toolbar!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Support for other browsers (esp. Safari) and platforms (hopefully Linux) is 
  hopefully coming in future versions - if you'd like to help then please <a href="mailto:webpad@dentedreality.com.au">get 
  in touch</a> with me to discuss testing etc. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Safari on OS X is <strong>not</strong> currently supported 
  - it has some problems with the HTML tools in webpad that cause them to function 
  incorrectly. </p>

<h2><a name="downloading_webpad"></a>Downloading webpad</h2>
<p>Download the latest version of webpad from its project page at <a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/" target="_blank">Dented 
  Reality</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dentedreality.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>webpad Project 
  Page</strong></a></p>
<p>It should be available in compressed <code>.zip</code> format and <code>.tar.gz</code> 
  formats, so you can get one that works for you.</p>
<a href="#top" class="b2t">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<h2><a name="installing_on_your_server"></a>Installing On Your Server</h2>
<p>To 'install' webpad, all you really need to do is copy the files from the download 
  into a directory on your server which is available from the web. You can uncompress 
  the file on your machine and then FTP all of the files onto your server, or 
  if you have shell (SSH/Telnet) access to your server, then it will be quicker 
  to upload the compressed file, and then decompress it there. If you're uncompressing 
  the file on your server, you should be able to use something like this (where 
  &lt;version&gt; is obviously the version of webpad that you have downloaded):</p>
<pre>tar -xzvf webpad-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
-- OR --
unzip webpad-&lt;version&gt;.zip</pre>
<p>webpad will uncompress into its own directory (named <code>webpad-&lt;version&gt;/</code>), 
  and will create all the files it needs.</p>
<p>If you're uploading the files individually then just create a directory on 
  your server and go ahead and upload the contents of the compressed download 
  into it.</p>
<p>If you access webpad using a browser right now, it will give you a message 
  saying that the configuration file is missing - that's coming up soon, but first 
  we need to check some permissions.</p>
<a href="#top" class="b2t">Back to top</a> 
<hr>
<h2><a name="configuring_permissions"></a>Configuring Permissions</h2>
<p>webpad will run just fine with PHP in either CGI mode, or installed as a module 
  within Apache or IIS. It has been most-thoroughly tested on Apache. If you have 
  CGI mode available to you (for example with the excellent <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?dentedreality" target="_blank">DreamHost</a>), 
  then I recommend you use that, because it means less hassles with file permissions, 
  since webpad effectively runs as 'you' (your user).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are running PHP in CGI mode, then it will run 
  as your user, so you shouldn't need to change any permissions. This is the recommended 
  mode to run PHP in for using webpad.</p>
<p>If you (or your host) are running PHP as a module, then you should be aware 
  that all file access is based on the user that the web-server is running as 
  (normally www, apache or IUSR_something). Because of this, you must give that 
  user access to the files/directories that you wish to edit using webpad. On 
  a *NIX/BSD machine (including OSX), you can do this at a shell prompt using 
  a command like this:</p>
<pre>chmod 777 *</pre>
<p>or, if you'd like to give webpad to a home directory and all subdirectories 
  (assuming the home directory is called <code>home_dir</code>, then change into 
  the directory above <code>home_dir</code>, and enter this:</p>
<pre>chmod -R 777 home_dir/</pre>
<p>You should be able to do the same thing in most FTP programs using a &quot;Change 
  Permissions&quot; option of some sort. If you are doing this, then you want 
  to give read, write and execute permissions to &quot;user, group and all&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Changing permissions to '777' gives all users full access 
  to your files. You should obviously <strong>not</strong> do this to any sensitive 
  files. If you are in a position to do so, you might consider adding your user 
  to the same user as the web server and only allowing that group access, or configuring 
  your server somehow else to avoid this problem. This is where running PHP in 
  CGI mode is handy!</p>
<p>Once you've configured those permissions, you also need to check webpad's <code>/temp/</code> 
  directory. Even if you don't give webpad the ability to edit itself (a good 
  idea security-wise), you need to allow it full access to its <code>/temp/</code> 
  directory to temporarily store files from places like FTP servers and uploads. 
  Do this (from inside the directory you installed webpad in, from the shell prompt) 
  like so:</p>
<pre>chmod -R 777 temp/</pre>
<p> As with the other permissions, you can also do this from your FTP client if 
  it has the option to change permissions on the server.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your configuration settings are stored in the file <code>/admin/configuration.php</code>;by 
  default, this file is accessible via the web, although it should be parsed as 
  a PHP file (and produce no visual output). I've included a <code>.htaccess</code> 
  file to prevent direct access to all files in the <code>/admin/</code> directory 
  except for <code>hash.php</code> (for creating a password hash). You should 
  confirm that this restriction works properly on your webserver and if not, implement 
  your own protection to prevent people accessing <code>configuration.php</code> 
  directly.</p>
<p>Now on to configuring your specific settings for webpad!</p>
<a href="#top" class="b2t">Back to top</a> 
<hr>
<h2><a name="configuring_your_settings"></a>Configuring Your Settings</h2>
<p>The first time you attempt to access webpad, you will be asked to configure 
  it, and be directed straight to the 'Settings' page. From there, you can adjust 
  all of the settings required to make webpad work just the way you want it to.</p>
<p>Make sure you enter a username to access webpad, and then specify a password 
  (and confirm it in the box next to that) to secure your installation. By default, 
  the Settings page will suggest the directory that webpad is installed in as 
  your home directory; you can change that to anything else you like. Once you've 
  entered a directory, you should click the 'Test' button to make sure webpad 
  can access it properly.</p>
<p>Some sections (Email, FTP and Plugins) need to be enabled (by checking the 
  checkbox next to the title) before you can change any of their settings.</p>
<p>When you are done configuring all your settings, click 'Save' and then you 
  can click the link to go back to webpad. If this was your first time entering 
  any configuration details, then you will need to log in using the username and 
  password you just set first.</p>
<h3><a name="system_settings"></a>System settings (optional)</h3>
<p>Now that you're done configuring your plugins, there are a collection of optional 
  settings that you may like to tweak as well. These settings are more 'system 
  level', so you definitely shouldn't <strong>need</strong> to change them, but 
  you can if you like. You can modify these in the <code>/admin/webpad_conf.php</code> 
  file if you need to.</p>
<pre>$config['mycomputer_icon'] = 'mycomputer.gif';<br>$config['mycomputer_label'] = 'My Computer';

$config['myserver_icon'] = 'myserver.gif';
$config['myserver_label'] = 'My Server';

$config['ftpserver_icon'] = 'ftpserver.gif';
$config['ftpserver_label'] = 'FTP Server';

$config['plugins_icon'] = 'plugins.gif';
$config['plugins_label'] = 'My Plugins';

$config['webpage_icon'] = 'webpage.gif';
$config['webpage_label'] = 'Webpage';</pre>
<p>These settings all control the icons and labels that appear in the Locations 
  Bar. If you'd like to change them, go ahead, but keep in mind that the labels 
  have to fit into a narrow bar, so they can't be too long. You can either copy 
  your own icons over the ones specified here, or enter a new filename. The icon 
  is expected to be in the <code>/images/</code> directory within webpad's installation, 
  and should be a 35 x 35px transparent-background <code>.gif</code> file, done 
  over a matte of hex code <code>#265997</code>.</p>
<pre>$file_types = array();<br>$file_types['css'] = 'Cascading Style Sheet (*.css)';<br>$file_types['html'] = 'Hypertext Document (*.html)';<br>$file_types['js'] = 'JavaScript Source File (*.js)';<br>$file_types['php'] = 'PHP Script File (*.php)';<br>$file_types['sql'] = 'SQL Dump File (*.sql)';<br>$file_types['txt'] = 'Text File (*.txt)';<br>$file_types['xml'] = 'XML Document (*.xml)';

$file_types['all_files'] = 'All File Types (*.*)';</pre>
<p>The <code>$file_types</code> array contains all of the recognized file formats 
  to display as options when saving a file to the client. This is simple used 
  to auto-complete the filename if the user forgets to put it when the type a 
  name. Set the array with the extension (no dot) as the key, and the label you'd 
  like to appear for that file type as the value.</p>
<pre>
$config['restrict_files'] = array('jpg', 'gif', 'png', 
                                  'xls', 'pdf', 'tar', 
                                  'gz', 'zip', 'ico', 
                                  'exe', 'swf', 'rar');</pre>
<p>This array restricts access to that users don't open files that webpad can't 
  handle. If any file with one of the extensions in this array is encountered 
  in a server or FTP listing, it will be avoided (and webpad will not allow access 
  to it).</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="testing_webpad"></a>Testing webpad</h2>
<p>Now that you have configured webpad, if you haven't already done so, you may 
  log in and try it out.</p>
<p>Point your browser to the directory you installed webpad in (e.g. <code>http://www.yourserver.com/webpad/</code>) 
  and you should get the login screen.</p>
<p>If you get an error message of some sort, it should tell you what you need 
  to do to fix it, so go back, take care of that, then come back to here and try 
  again.</p>
<p>Assuming you get the page asking you to log in, enter the username you specified, 
  and the password you specified on the Settings page. Click 'Log In' and you 
  should be taken directly to webpad.</p>
<p>Now you can try opening some files from around the place and make sure everything 
  works. If something doesn't appear to work, it's normally because the permissions 
  on your server are wrong. Go back, check all your settings, make sure the permissions 
  on your server are set correctly and then try again.</p>
<p>Now you'll want to know what all those cool-looking buttons and things do, 
  just jump over to the <a href="user_manual.html">User Manual</a> and find out!</p>
